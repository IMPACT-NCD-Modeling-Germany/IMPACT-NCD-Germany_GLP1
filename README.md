# IMPACT NCD Germany microsimulation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPACT NCD Germany is an implementation of the IMPACTncd framework, which was developed by Chris
Kypridemos with contributions from Peter Crowther (Melandra Ltd), Maria
Guzman-Castillo, Amandine Robert, and Piotr Bandosz.

IMPACT NCD Germany was implemented and adapted to the German context by Karl M.F.
Emmert-Fees with support by Chris Kypridemos. Researchers interested in using the model
for Germany are encouraged to reach out via email to: karl.emmert-fees@tum.de

## Current implementation

IMPACT NCD Germany was originally adapted to Germany to evaluate the long-term health
and economic impact of sugar-sweetened beverage taxation in the German population.

This version of the model was extended and adapted to enable the evaluation of scenarios for GLP-1 receptor agonist uptake in Germany.

The model currently supports a limited amount of exposures and diseases. However, given
the appropriate data, the model can flexibly expanded to other disease contexts and exposures clusters.

Currently implemented diseases are: Obesity, coronary heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

Currently implemented exposures are: Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (inlc. sugar content),
fruit juice consumption (incl. sugar content), body mass index, blood pressure, and cholesterol.

Individuals in the model can experience mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke or non-cardiovascular
causes. The model is currently stratified by age and sex, only. However, similarly to the extension
with respect to exposures and diseases, additionally stratification variables can be added relatively easy
given the respective data.

## Further information

- The model is currently mainly based on the German KORA cohort.
- The model currently only compiles under Linux.
- Active development of the C++ component is carried out by Chris Kypridemos at the University of Liverpool.
